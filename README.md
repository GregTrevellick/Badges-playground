## Overview 

A code repo, not an app per se, that adds/updates badges to your other repos' readme files

- handy for multiple repos, especially with multiple integrations
- any badges, proprietary via 3rd party or 100% your own
- bonus will also update this badge repo

### Usage

fork this repo remotely e.g. to github.com/myname/readmebadges or bitbucket.com/myothername/myreadmebadges

clone your fork locally e.g. to c:\git\readmebadges or c:\git\myreadmebadges

clone some/all your repos (regardless of host e.g. github, bitbucket, vsts, other) locally

edit the code in c:\git\readmebadges or c:\git\myreadmebadges to use the badges you want & to target your repos in the same folder as this repo

commit everything
