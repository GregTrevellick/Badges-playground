YES greenkeeper [](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/GregTrevellick/OpenInApp.Launcher.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)  
   Greenkeeper will open an Initial Pull Request to update all dependencies at once
   It will add the Greenkeeper badge to your projectâ€™s readme.md
   The initial PR will not be opened if all dependencies are already up to date and the readme.md already has a badge (in this case Greenkeeper is silently enabled)

YES codecov (need to add yaml file) https://codecov.io/gh
