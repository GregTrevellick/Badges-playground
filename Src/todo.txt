YES greenkeeper [](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/GregTrevellick/OpenInApp.Launcher.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)  
   Greenkeeper will open an Initial Pull Request to update all dependencies at once
   It will add the Greenkeeper badge to your project’s readme.md
   The initial PR will not be opened if all dependencies are already up to date and the readme.md already has a badge (in this case Greenkeeper is silently enabled)

YES codecov (need to add yaml file) https://codecov.io/gh 
   https://github.com/codecov/example-csharp
   https://github.com/codecov/example-typescript
